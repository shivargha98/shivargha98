## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **AI/ML Engineer** specializing in **Generative AI**, **Agentic Systems**, and **Deep Learning**. I love tackling challenging problems in computer vision and building intelligent systems that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.


## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- 🤖 Building **agentic AI systems** with LangGraph and advanced orchestration patterns
- 📚 Exploring **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architectures and optimization techniques
- 🔌 Experimenting with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for seamless AI integrations
- 🏏 Applying AI/ML to real-world problems like cricket analytics, Fintech
